## Running the project

To run the project, you need to have a LaTeX compiler installed or like me, you can use an texlive docker image to compile the project.

```bash
docker run --rm \
       --volume "$(pwd):/workdir" \
       --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
       texlive/texlive:latest \
       pdflatex -output-directory=./build main.tex
```

> **Important**: You need to have the `build` folder created before running the command above. Do not worry, the folder is already ignored by git.
